steps to make it

1: Gather the ingredients.

2: In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs and milk until well combined. Mix in the club soda.

3: Add the flour and salt and stir with a whisk until only a few lumps of flour remain.

4: Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. As the flour is absorbed by the wet ingredients, the batter will smooth out.

5: Once rested, stir the batter until it is completely smooth

6: Heat an 8-inch nonstick crepe pan or skillet. Add 1 of the teaspoon butter and 1 teaspoon of the oil.

7: Add about 1/4 cup of batter to the pan, tilting and swirling so it covers most of the bottom of the pan.

8: Fry about 2 to 3 minutes or until the bottom is lightly browned. Flip over and brown the second side. Remove to a platter.

9: Continue with the cooking process, adding the remaining butter and oil as necessaryâ€”probably every third crepe. Stack the cooked crepes to keep warm.

10: Serve and enjoy.
